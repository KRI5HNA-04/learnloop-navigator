# Welcome to your PatWise: Adaptive E-learning Platform

PathWise is an all-in-one integrated e-learning platform designed to streamline the educational journey for students. By consolidating the best features from popular educational websites into a single platform, PathWise eliminates the need to navigate between multiple sites while studying.

The platform incorporates gamified learning experiences inspired by Khan Academy, where students earn e-coins by completing courses and maintaining streaks, redeemable for merchandise or premium content. It features interactive technology roadmaps similar to roadmap.sh, allowing users to follow structured learning paths for various technologies. Social elements include streak tracking and leaderboards borrowed from GitHub and competitive coding sites, fostering healthy competition and accountability.

PathWise also offers practical tools like a distraction-free YouTube player, comprehensive documentation hub, and collaborative coding environment. The platform culminates with skills verification through assessments that award recognized certificates.

Built using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Shadcn components, PathWise creates a cohesive ecosystem that enhances productivity and learning outcomes by bringing everything students need for exam preparation or interview readiness into one intuitive interface.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
